# Data-Science-Project-For-Finding-Property-Prices
A Data Science project with Machine Learning elements used to find a housing price by specifying criteria in California.
This repository contains my first project. It shows a way to narrow down houses in a DataFrame using latitude 
and longitude or an address and gives the average price as an outcome. The Notebook has many visualizations using Folium 
library and *.JSON file as a layer. The files 'cleaned_houses', 'houses_df_for_choropleth' are created along the way 
and are made into files from the Notebook for easy access. 'california_json' is a text file, which stores the JSON polygons
used to represent the California Counties. 'combined_addresses' and 'latitude_longitude' are files saved again from
the Notebook. They are produced by a online geocoder it takes a lot of time to compile and it is easier to save them into files. Word cloud and Machine learning algorithms used as well. Such as ML Supervised learning: Linear Discriminant Analysis 
K-Nearest Neighbors and Train/Test Split model evaluation procedure.
